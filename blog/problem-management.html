  <h1>Why problem management fails in growing organisations</h1>

  <div class="meta">
    Governance • Operational Risk • Board Oversight
  </div>

  <p>
    As organisations scale, incidents become more frequent — but paradoxically,
    the ability to learn from them often declines.
  </p>

  <p>
    Problem management fails not because teams lack intelligence or intent,
    but because ownership becomes blurred, escalation weakens, and governance
    mechanisms lag behind growth.
  </p>

  <p>
    In many boardrooms, recurring issues are discussed repeatedly without
    ever being formally classified as problems requiring root-cause resolution.
  </p>

  <p>
    The result is a cycle of temporary fixes, firefighting, and increasing
    operational risk — until a regulatory event, audit failure, or customer
    impact forces attention.
  </p>

  <p>
    Strong problem management requires discipline:
    clear accountability, documented causes, corrective actions, and preventive
    controls that boards can see and track.
  </p>

  <p>
    Without this, organisations don’t just experience failures —
    they institutionalise them.
  </p>
